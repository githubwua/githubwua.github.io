# Directory Structure Ideas

As a cloud developer support engineer, I need to help developers solve their issues.
To make this efficient, I am trying to come up with the ideal directory structure to manage my tools and files.

# Goals

- Reproduce issues quickly
- Test code ideas quickly

# What I need

- test data (e.g. wav, csv, jpg, etc)
- code snippets (e.g. java, py, sh) (minimal)
- code demo (e.g. multiple java files) (advanced)
- code template (code by providing arguments)
- cheatsheet (examples of how to run a command)
- notes (how to do something) (minimal)
- blogs (document ideas) (advanced)
